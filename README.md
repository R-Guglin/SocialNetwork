# SocialNetwork
C++ model of a working social network. Users can create a new account, log in or out, make posts and comments on their own wall or others', "like" posts, or add and remove friend connections.
**This project was designed and coded under the guidance of Dr. Natalie Linnell, professor of the Spring 2024 Advanced Programming class at Santa Clara University. This code was submitted as my final project.**
Usage: Sample posts.txt and users.txt files are provided. You will need to have Qt Creator installed in order to run the .pro file. To use the .txt files, either:
1. Modify USERS_READ_FILE, USERS_WRITE_FILE, POSTS_READ_FILE, and POSTS_WRITE_FILE in socialnetworkwindow.cpp to include the EXACT file path to those files
or 2. Place those files in the project's build directory folder. You can find this by clicking Project -> Build on the Qt Creator sidebar and then copying or modifying the build directory listed there.

Have fun! Note that this is still a work in progress and additional features/corrections will be added soon.
